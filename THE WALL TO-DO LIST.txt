THE WALL TO-DO LIST

-Ysort is  must
-Fix Dash Trail Mirroring
-KNOCKBACK
	-When attacking u get "knockbacked" [or maybe reduced friction?]
	-When hit, you get knockbacked
	-When dashing into a wall you get knockbacked [?]
-Make a HURT system (at least for player)
	-How will the player switch to HURT if it's in a used FSM
	^You OVERRIDE the FSM to make HURT the current STATE
	^-But even in over riding, who listens for the condition and where does it 		listen?
	^You put the "listener" in the FSM Handler!
	
-Make a DEATH system (at least for player)
-Unify Attack and Movement States
	-Look for nodes that rely on "Seeing" the attack fsm [like the player charbod]

BUG REPORT:
WHEN CLICKING ATTACK [EITHER MELEE OR GUN], DASH GOES INTO THAT DIRECTION

Sometimes, when spamming DASH AND [ONE OF THE] ATTACK BUTTONS, THE DASH GETS WEIRD AND THE STATE MACHINE THROWS AN ERROR [INVALID CHANGE STATE]

The animation player throws a WARNING, something about the HITBOX COLLISIONPOLY
^^SOLVED
